## ?? How To Use Your New Testing Environment

### Option A: Full VM Testing (For Thorough Validation)

```powershell
# 1. Create the VM (one-time setup)
cd C:\Users\steph\source\repos\OCNGill\rOCM_Installer_Win11
.\testing\vm_setup_hyperv.ps1

# 2. Start and connect
Start-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM"
vmconnect localhost "ROCm_Test_VM"

# 3. Install Windows 11 (follow on-screen wizard)
# 4. Copy your MSI installer to the VM
# 5. Test the installer
# 6. Verify everything works
# 7. Take snapshots as needed
```

**Best for:**
- Complete installer validation
- WSL2 integration testing
- Registry verification
- Uninstaller testing
- Multiple test scenarios (using snapshots)

### Option B: Sandbox Testing (For Quick Iterations)

```powershell
# 1. Build your installer
.\build_installer.ps1 -Configuration Release

# 2. Launch Sandbox
.\testing\ROCm_Installer_Sandbox.wsb

# 3. Test inside Sandbox (takes ~2 minutes)
# 4. Close Sandbox (everything resets)
# 5. Repeat!
```

**Best for:**
- Quick "does it install?" checks
- UI/wizard testing
- File deployment verification
- Fast iteration during development

- [ ] Install Windows 11 in VM
- [ ] Build MSI: `.\build_installer.ps1`
- [ ] Copy MSI to VM
- [ ] Run installer in VM

### Rapid Testing
- [ ] Launch Sandbox
- [ ] Test installer
- [ ] Review logs
- [ ] Make fixes
- [ ] Rebuild and repeat

## ?? Key Insights From Your Requirements

### What You Asked For:
> "VM with 4 cores (8 threads), 24GB RAM, on F:\ drive"

**? Done** - Script creates exactly this configuration

### What You Needed:
> "Pass through for PCIe (for GPU testing)"

**? Clarified** - GPU passthrough isn't possible in Hyper-V, but:
- VM tests the **installer functionality** (files, registry, WSL setup)
- End users will test on **real hardware** with their GPUs
- This approach is **correct** for installer testing

### What I Added:
- **Nested virtualization** - So WSL2 works inside the VM
- **Windows Sandbox** - For 10x faster iteration
- **Comprehensive docs** - So you never get stuck
- **Snapshots strategy** - To save time on repeated tests

---

## ?? Pro Tips

### Save Time With Snapshots
```powershell
# After Windows 11 install (before any testing)
Checkpoint-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM" -SnapshotName "Clean_Install"

# Before each installer test
Checkpoint-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM" -SnapshotName "Before_Test_$(Get-Date -Format 'HHmm')"

# Restore to clean state instantly
Restore-VMCheckpoint -Name "Clean_Install" -VMName "ROCm_Test_VM" -Confirm:$false
```

### Use Both Testing Methods
- **Morning**: Develop and fix issues using Sandbox (fast!)
- **Afternoon**: Full validation in VM (thorough!)
- **Before Release**: Test everything in VM multiple times

### Automate Common Tasks
All the scripts support automation:
```powershell
# Unattended VM creation
.\testing\vm_setup_hyperv.ps1 -VMName "ROCm_Test" -MemoryGB 16 -SkipISO

# Auto-test in Sandbox
.\testing\auto_test_sandbox.ps1  # (you can create this!)
```

## ?? When You Need Help

### Scripts Not Working?
1. Check you're running PowerShell as **Administrator**
2. Run: `Get-ExecutionPolicy` (should be RemoteSigned or Unrestricted)
3. Enable if needed: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force`

### VM Issues?
- See `testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md` ? "Common Issues & Solutions"
- Check Hyper-V services: `Get-Service vmms, vmcompute`
- Verify virtualization enabled in BIOS

### Sandbox Issues?
- Enable feature: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Containers-DisposableClientVM`
- Check WSB file paths match your build output location
- Reboot if feature was just enabled

### Installer Issues?
- Review installation log files
- Check MSI was built successfully
- Verify Windows 11 Pro (not Home)
- Ensure clean Windows (no previous ROCm installs)

## ?? Next Steps - Your Workflow

### Day 1: Setup
```powershell
# 1. Commit these testing files
.\testing\commit_testing_files.ps1
git push origin master

# 2. Create VM
.\testing\vm_setup_hyperv.ps1

# 3. Install Windows 11 in VM
# (Follow wizard, takes ~30 minutes)

# 4. Take clean snapshot
Checkpoint-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM" -SnapshotName "Clean_Win11"
```

### Day 2+: Testing Loop
```powershell
# Morning: Quick tests
.\build_installer.ps1 -Configuration Release
.\testing\ROCm_Installer_Sandbox.wsb
# Test ? Review ? Fix ? Repeat

# Afternoon: Full test
Start-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM"
# Copy MSI, install, verify, document

# Before leaving: Snapshot successful tests
Checkpoint-VM -Name "ROCm_Test_VM" -SnapshotName "Working_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')"
```

3. ?? Check ALL logs for errors
4. ? Follow the testing checklist

### After Testing:
1. ?? Review all verification results

## ?? You're All Set!

Everything is ready for professional-grade installer testing. The scripts are automated, the documentation is comprehensive, and your testing environment is AMD-worthy.

**Remember:** You asked me to remind you to merge and clean up the repos after completion. 

? **REMINDER**: After testing is complete, don't forget to:
- Merge any test results or fixes back to the main branch
- Clean up any temporary test branches
- Sync local repo with GitHub
- Consider creating a release tag for the tested version

Now go make that installer perfect! ??
