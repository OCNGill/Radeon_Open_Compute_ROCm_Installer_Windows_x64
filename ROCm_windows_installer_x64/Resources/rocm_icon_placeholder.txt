# ROCm Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the ROCm_icon.ico file.

## Creating the Icon

You need to create a multi-resolution ICO file with the following sizes:
- 16x16
- 32x32
- 48x48
- 256x256

### Option 1: Use an Online Converter
1. Find or create a ROCm/AMD logo image (PNG or JPG)
2. Visit https://www.icoconverter.com/
3. Upload your image
4. Select all size options
5. Download as ROCm_icon.ico
6. Replace this file with the downloaded icon

### Option 2: Use GIMP
1. Create or import a 256x256 image
2. Export as .ico format
3. Select multiple sizes during export

### Option 3: Use ImageMagick
```bash
convert ROCm_logo.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,48,32,16 ROCm_icon.ico
```

### Option 4: Use a Temporary Icon
For testing purposes, you can use Windows default icons:
```powershell
Copy-Item "$env:SystemRoot\System32\shell32.dll" "temp.dll"
# Extract icon #21 from shell32.dll using Resource Hacker or similar tool
```

### Recommended Design
- Use AMD red color (#ED1C24)
- Include "ROCm" text or logo
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Temporary Solution for Building
If you need to build immediately without a custom icon, you can:
1. Use one of the default Windows icons temporarily
2. Or comment out the icon reference in Product.wxs until you have a proper icon

The installer will still work without a custom icon, it just won't look as professional.
