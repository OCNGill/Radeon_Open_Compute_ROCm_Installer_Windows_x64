ok, so we have everything loaded from the local repo - once completed remind me to merge the clean up the repos to match github.

I need you to be the role of a SENIOR software developer at AMD - and Lisa Su has given this task to YOU to get this installer working for the masses.   
In the Github repository (https://github.com/OCNGill/rOCM_Installer_Win11.git), you'll see the branch dedicated to the windows installer .msi (full_msi_installer)(https://github.com/OCNGill/rOCM_Installer_Win11.git).  So, I'm at the point on the main rig (my main PC) with (ryzen 5900x with 48 GB total RAM with radeon 7900XTX 24 GB GDDR6) that I'm ready to build the VM here for testing.  

VM specs:
	1.) I'd like to set it up with 4 dedicated cores (8 threads) - 24 GB RAM and whatever disk space you 	think is appropriate.  

	2.) You'll see I created a dedicated folder on f:\ for this purpose...it's PCIE4.  
	
	3.)Speaking of, remember we're testing an installer that's primarily for GPU's - so we'll need all the pass throughs for PCIE in my VM's from what I've researched (think about this).  
	
	4.) Once the VM is created - leave it in a state such 	that I can actually run my msi installer in there to see if it works.  I've never done this sort of thing - so I'd like to have you walk me through the testing when we get there.  
	
	5.)Also bear in mind I haven't set up a VM in windows in years...hence why I'm having you do it properly for me.
	
	If you can handle all of that - then commit to the repos (the addition of this file and what we just did).
	
	Thank you!
